# Java143 Projects/Lab

This repository contains Java projects completed as part of my CS 142 / Java 143 coursework.

## üìÅ Projects Included

- **Project 1: [Circular list]**
  - Implements a custom **Circular Linked List** and uses it to solve the classic **Josephus Problem** ‚Äî a theoretical problem related to eliminating people in a circle until one remains.

- **Project 2: [BST]**
Implements a generic binary search tree with methods for adding elements, checking size and existence, tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), deep cloning, reversing the tree, and comparing two trees for structural equality.

- **Project 3: [Ternary Tree]**
  - Implements a character-by-character autocomplete system using a ternary search tree (TST). Efficiently stores and retrieves string prefixes to provide real-time autocomplete suggestions based on partial input.

- **Project 4: [Priority Queue]**
  - Implements multiple minimum priority queue structures: an unsorted array, a binary heap, and an optimized heap with indexed tracking. All versions follow a shared interface and support adding, removing, and updating elements by priority.

  - ## üìÅLab Included

- **Lab 1: [DataList]**
  - Implements a simplified version of an ArrayList for storing `Integer` objects. Supports basic operations like insertion, deletion, and access using a fixed-size internal array.

- **Lab 2: [BST]**
  - Implements a generic binary search tree with support for inserting elements, checking for existence, tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), reversing the tree, deep cloning, and comparing trees for equality.

- **Lab 3: [Left-leaning BST]**
  - Implements a self-balancing binary search tree using left-leaning red-black tree logic. Supports insertion, deletion, height calculation, and maintains balance through color-based rotations.
 
- **Lab 4: [Max/MinPQ]**
  - Implements a max-oriented priority queue using a binary heap. Supports insertion and deletion of the maximum element while maintaining heap order with bubbling operations.
